                    Dear participant,<br>
                    <br>
                    I would like to invite you to participate in this study which forms part of our research. <br>
                    Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you to understand why the
                    research is being done and what your participation will involve. Please take time to read the
                    following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Ask me if there is anything
                    that is not clear or if you would like more information.
                </p>

                <div class="text-lg pt-3 font-bold italic" style="color:darkred"> What is the purpose of the study?</div>
                <p class="text-xl max-w-4xl text-left pt-4">
                    The purpose of the study is the evaluation of an email. In this study, which will take about 15
                    minutes, we ask you to imagine that you are Alice, a 28-year-old woman living in Rome, Italy.<br>
                    Alice uses several social networks, including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok. Alice also
                    uses eBay and Amazon to shop online with her Italian credit card. Alice loves music and goes to
                    live concerts every month.<br>
                    Alice works for an IT company and has agreed to test a new email client that her company has
                    recently introduced. To test the new email client, Alice has to interact with it by READING ALL her
                    emails in her inbox and checking that any links in them work.
                </p>

                <div class="text-lg pt-3 font-bold italic"> Why have I been invited to take part? </div>
                <p class="text-xl max-w-4xl text-left pt-4">
                    You are being invited to participate in this study because you decided to take part through the
                    Prolific platform. Any English-speaker user of 18 years of age or older is eligible for this study,
                    with no specific restrictions on demographic or expertise levels. Participants are also asked to
                    possess a PC and take part of the studio using it (participation via mobile/tablet/other devices
                    is not allowed).
                </p>

                <div class="text-lg pt-3 font-bold italic"> What will happen if I take part?</div>
                <p class="text-xl max-w-4xl text-left pt-4">
                    If you choose to take part in the study you will be asked to interact with the prototype of an email
                    client by imagining yourself as Alice, a fictious 28-year-old employee that was asked to test the
                    new email client of her company. You, as Alice, have to interact with the client by reading all the
                    emails in her inbox and checking that any links in them work. At the end of the study you will be
                    asked to fill in a few brief questionnaires to express your evaluation to what you will experience
                    during the study. <br>
                    <br>
                    Participation will take place online and will ask about 15 minutes. As part of participation you
                    will be asked to provide your honest and considered answers to the questionnaires you will be
                    administered. The interaction with the email client should also not be rushed. You must not insert
                    any data that could identify your person in your answers. You need to insert your prolific ID (which
                    we cannot link to your identity) to receive the compensation for the participation to the study and
                    to link your demographic (anonymous) data to your response.

                <p class="text-xl max-w-4xl text-left pt-4">
                    Participation is completely voluntary. You should only take part if you want to and choosing not to
                    take part will not disadvantage you in any way. Once you have read the information sheet, please
                    contact us if you have any questions that will help you make a decision about taking part. If you
                    decide to take part we will ask you to sign a consent form and you will be given a copy of this
                    consent form to keep.

                    The reward for participating in this study is of £3, above the Prolific average compensation of
                    £9/hour.<br>
                    <b>Important:</b> in order to redeem the reward for participation, the completion link at the end of
                    the study must be clicked, which will redirect the browser to the Prolific website to confirm the
                    participation. If this last step is skipped, it will be impossible for us or Prolific to acknowledge
                    a user actually completing the study.

                    There is no actual risk in participating in this study. You will be exposed to emails that were
                    specifically handcrafted for this study and any link in them will be disabled to prevent accessing
                    external websites.
