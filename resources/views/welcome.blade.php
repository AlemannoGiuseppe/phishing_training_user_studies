                    In this study, we ask you to imagine being Andrea, a 28 years old guy who lives in Rome, Italy. <br>
                    Andrea uses various social networks, among which are Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok. Moreover, Andrea uses eBay and Amazon to make online purchases with his Italian credit card. Andrea loves music and goes to live concerts monthly. <br/>
                    Andrea works for an IT company and has accepted to test a new email client that his company has recently adopted. To test the new email client, Andrea must interact with it, by reading all his emails in the inbox and checking that the links in them, if any, are working.
